# IT-ToolBox PowerShell Modules

A PowerShell module designed to be the Swiss Army knife for SysAdmins and IT Operators.



**Note:** This is the development repository for version 2.0.0 of the IT-Toolbox PowerShell module and has to be considered under heavy development. Project folders have been reorganized to adhere to best practice and new functions are being added to the module.
