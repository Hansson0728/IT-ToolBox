# IT-ToolBox PowerShell Modules

A PowerShell module designed to be the Swiss Army knife for SysAdmins and IT Operators including function raging from simple email format validation to encryption of files folders via GnuGPG.

Module is still under development as new cmdlets are being added but all code has been tested and being used in production for automation purposes.

Complete history of development and changes can be found in the **[ChangeLog](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)**

## Development and distribution

All code in the module is released under the *MIT* license which can be found [here](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/blob/master/LICENSE) so you are free to download, modify and redistribute part or all of the module's code.

## Documentation

Plan is to create a dedicated Wiki for the project but I'm also creating a list of posts on my **[website](https://PsCustomObject.github.io)** containing examples of the various functions making up the module. 

This is a work in progress so if an article is missing feel free to leave a comment or create an issue in the issue board.

## Issue reporting

All code is thoroughly before being released and used in a production environment, *[eating my own dowg food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)*, so usually I notice bugs immediately and try to fix them as soon as possible while also creatinga an issue to keep track of the updates. 

Anyhow if you experience an issue, have a suggestion, idea for a new feature or enhancement for the code or performance please use **[Issue Board](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/issues)** to submit a request so that I can analyze and act upon, of course PR are more than welcome!

## Note on removed functions

All SCP related functions are being removed from the module as those are being developed and integrated as part of as standalone module called **PowerSCP** which can find [here](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerScp)
