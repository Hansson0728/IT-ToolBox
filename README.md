# IT-ToolBox PowerShell Modules

A PowerShell module designed to be the Swiss Army knife for SysAdmins and IT Operators including function raging from simple email format validation to encryption of files folders via GnuGPG.

**Note** While all the code is tested and considered *Production Ready* I am still actively evolving the code and addingnew functions as part of the version 2.0.0 development cycle so changes are to be expected. Once code has reached stability I will release an MSI installer for the module and a *standard* one PSM1 file version.
