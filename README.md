# IT-ToolBox PowerShell Modules

A PowerShell module designed to be the Swiss Army knife for SysAdmins and IT Operators including function raging from simple email format validation to encryption of files folders via GnuGPG.

Module is still under development as new cmdlets are being added but all code has been tested and being used in production for automation purposes.

Complete history of development and changes can be found in the **[ChangeLog](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)**

## Development and distribution

All code in the module is released under the *MIT* license which can be found [here](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/blob/master/LICENSE) so you are free to download, modify and redistribute part or all of the module's code.

## Documentation

While plan is to create a *GitBook* for the project I am creating documentation to the module's functions in my blog via a series of artciles so refer to my **[website](https://PsCustomObject.github.io)** for examples and documentation of the various functions in the module. If an article is missing feel free to leave a comment or create an issue in the issue board.

## Issue reporting

All code is thoroughly before being released and used in a production environment, *[eating my own dowg food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)*, so usually I notice bugs immediately and try to fix them as soon as possible trying to file an issue for tracking purposes.

Anyhow if you experience an issue, have a suggestion, idea for a new feature or enhancement for the code or performance please use **[Issue Board](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox/issues)** to submit a request so that I can analyze and act upon.
